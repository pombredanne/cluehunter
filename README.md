# cluehunter
**ClueHunter** is an auxiliary tool for crash point reverse data flow analysis. It generate data flow graph according to the gdb debug log(C program source code level). It receive manually specified sink variables that cause the last line crash and perform interprocedural analysis on the log trace. For obtaining the auto-debug trace, the tool `robot_dbg.exp` in ClueHunter requires the program under debug to be compiled with profiled code information (gcc **-g -save-temps** option).During the current develop stage, only command line program is supported. Please consult [here](http://cluehunter.readthedocs.org/) for detail documents. 

##Quick Start Cookbook
###Install
ClueHunter depends on [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) to generate the picture from the dot file.
####For Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get instsall graphviz
git clone https://github.com/yangke/cluehunter.git
```
That's done.

####Start Funny
First make sure your C program under analysis is compiled by **gcc** with **-g -save-temps** option.
In most cases you can specify this in the configure procedure like this:
```
$./configure CFLAGS="-g -save-temps" CXXFLAGS="-g -save-temps" --prefix=$YOUR_INSTALL_PATH 
```
Otherwise you may have to change the `Makefile`.
Then modify the 15 line in `cluehunter/robot_dbg.exp` to fit with your own debug scenarios.
Here is an example for executable program `swf2xml` test in [swfmill-0.3.3](http://swfmill.org/releases/).

```
spawn gdb --args swfmill swf2xml exploit_it_to_crash
```
The input file `exploit_it_to_crash` will cause the crash of `swf2xml`.

Then use `robot_dbg.exp` to debug your program automatically.
It executes gdb `next` command when meeting lines which contains library or system call site, other cases it executes gdb `step` command.
Copy the `robot_dbg.exp` into the directory of binary executable program: `swf2xml` and the exploit input: `exploit_it_to_crash`.
This will make the former command valid(`spawn gdb -q --args swfmill swf2xml exploit_it_to_crash`).

```
swfmill-0.3.3_install_bin_path$ls
... exploit_it_to_crash ... robot_dbg.exp ... swf2xml ...
swfmill-0.3.3_install_bin_path$./robot_dbg.exp
...
swfmill-0.3.3_install_bin_path$ls
... exploit_it_to_crash ... gdb.txt ... robot_dbg.exp ... swf2xml ...
```
Every thing come handy, we got the debug trace `gdb.txt` besides them. Then we can use `cluehunter.py` to analyze this trace.
```
python cluehunter.py -t path_to/gdb.txt\
      -vs length -ps N -o . -n telescope -l 1
```
This command will use the test trace located at gdb.txt to perform reverse data flow analysis for variable `length`. The sensitive crash data `length` itself are marked as tainted. The access pattern of `length`, `'N'`, means direct access. Another mark `'\*'` means we need to dereference this pointer to access sensitive sink data we cared about. Note that the `\*` must be quoted with `""` or `''` in command line.  
This command will cause ClueHunter output `telescope.dot` and use [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) to generate `telescope.svg` beside it.`-vs`, `-ps` and `-t` are three mandatory options which specify the names of sink variables, patterns and the trace to analysis respectively.
`-o` option specified the output directory. `-l` specified the parsed trace redundancy level.
`0` means only remove the line redundancy in same function and `1` means remove both the inner function and inter-function reduandancy.

If you want to analyze variables on specific trace line, you may need `-i` option. For example: `-i -1` specifies the last line in `trace.txt`, and `-i -2` specifies the line of last but one.
You can also use positive line number. For instance, `-i 100` means the 100 line in the `trace.txt`. **Note that the lines we talk here are the lines in the parsed middle file: `trace.txt`**.
The last line(`-i -1`) in `trace.txt` corresponds to the last none-empty line above the error information `Program receive ...` in `gdb.txt`.

ClueHunter can analyze the function call caused by macros by expanding them. It leverages the preprocessed `*.i` files generated by `-save-temps` option of `gcc` to make a query. To use this function, you have to specify the path of the compiled C project corresponding to the log trace under analysis. This function is not available by default, please use `-m` to specify the compiled C project path.

Here is an executable test command which analyze the trace `gdb-swfmill-0.3.3.txt` provided in test module.  
```
python cluehunter.py -t test/gdb_logs/swfmill-0.3.3/gdb-swfmill-0.3.3.txt\
      -vs length -ps 'N' -o . -n telescope -l 1 -m test/gdb_logs/swfmill-0.3.3/swfmill-0.3.3
```

##Complete Usage

```
usage: cluehunter.py [-h] -ps PATTERNS [PATTERNS ...] -vs VARIABLES
                     [VARIABLES ...] [-l LEVEL] -t TRACE [-o OUTPUT_PATH]
                     [-m C_PROJECT_DIR] [-n NAME] [-d | -v | -q]
                     
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LEVEL, --level LEVEL
                        Redundancy level of the parsing. 0 means just remove
                        inline or innner function redundancy; 1 means remove
                        both of the inline and interprocedural reduandancy.
  -t TRACE, --trace TRACE
                        The file path of gdb trace log, for example,
                        ./gdb.txt. This log should be generated by
                        robot_dbg.exp.
  -o OUTPUT_PATH, --output-directory OUTPUT_PATH
                        The output directory in which .dot and .png files will
                        be dumped in this path.
  -m C_PROJECT_DIR, --c-project-dir C_PROJECT_DIR
                        The C project directory with the .i files maked by gcc
                        '-save-temps' option. Usually the we add this flags
                        during configure: ./configure CFLAGS='-g -save-temps'.
  -n NAME, --name NAME  The prefix name of the generated .dot and .png files.
  -d, --debug           Enable debug output.
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity.
  -q, --quiet           Be quiet during processing.

sinks:
  -ps PATTERNS [PATTERNS ...], --patterns PATTERNS [PATTERNS ...]
                        Specify the access pattern list of the sink
                        identifiers. Patterns must be "*" or "N" separated
                        with blanks. "N" means direct access, "*" means this
                        is a pointer of the cared data.
  -vs VARIABLES [VARIABLES ...], --variables VARIABLES [VARIABLES ...]
                        Specify the identifier name of the sink variables.
